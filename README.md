# Bill-Making-part-2
This project aims to develop a digital bill handling system that replaces traditional cash-based and paper-based billing with secure, fast, and convenient digital payments. The system allows users to generate, view, and pay bills online using electronic payment modes instead of standing in queues or handling physical cash and receipts.
